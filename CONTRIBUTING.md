# Contributing

Thank you very much for contributing to the AETHER! Below are some guidelines to ensure we can integrate new contributions effectively:

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make, preferably via an Issue, with the administrators of this repository before making a change.

In general, all contributions should be made via Pull Requests.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/WUR-AI/aether/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Please link a PR to the open issue it resolves, if relevant.
2. You can either request a merge into `develop` or into `main`, depending on the level of change and compatibility with existing and other features.
3. All PRs must be reviewed before being merged. Please assign others to review the code.
4. Ensure all automatic tests are passed before merging.
5. If you have developed a new feature that is not covered by the current tests, you are encouraged to implement tests for them. This will help make your contribution more robust and ensure that future contributors won’t accidentally break your work.
6. If any new dependencies are introduced, please update requirement files accordingly.
7. If needed, update the README.md and/or docs with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
